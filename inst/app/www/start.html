<dl> Quantitative bias analysis allows to estimate nonrandom errors in
  epidemiologic studies, assessing the magnitude and direction of biases, and
  quantifying their uncertainties. Every study has some random error due to its
  limited sample size, and is susceptible to systematic errors as well, from
  selection bias to the presence of (un)known confounders or information bias
  (measurement error, including misclassification). Bias analysis methods were
  compiled by Lash et al. in their book <a href =
  'https://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387879604'>Applying Quantitative Bias
  Analysis to Epidemiologic Data</a>. This Shiny app implements these bias
  analyses using <a href =
                    'https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=episensr'>episensr</a> R package.
